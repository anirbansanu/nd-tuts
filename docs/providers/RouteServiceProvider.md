## RouteServiceProvider.js

This file contains the `RouteServiceProvider` class, which is responsible for registering routes in an Express application.

### Class: RouteServiceProvider

#### Constructor

- **Parameters**: `app` (Express application) - The Express application instance.
- **Description**: Initializes the `RouteServiceProvider` with the Express application instance.

#### Method: registerRoutes()

- **Description**: Registers routes by synchronizing route files from the specified directory.
- **Steps**:
  1. Constructs the routes path by joining the current directory with '../routes'.
  2. Logs a message indicating the start of route synchronization.
  3. Reads the files in the routes directory synchronously.
  4. For each file ending with '.js':
     - Requires the route file.
     - Logs the path of the route file.
     - Mounts the route's router using the route's base path in the Express application.

### Example Usage:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const RouteServiceProvider = require('./RouteServiceProvider');

const app = express();

const routeServiceProvider = new RouteServiceProvider(app);
routeServiceProvider.registerRoutes();

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

This example creates an Express application, initializes the RouteServiceProvider with the app instance, registers routes using the registerRoutes() method, and starts the server listening on port 3000.


This Markdown documentation explains the purpose of the `RouteServiceProvider.js` file, its constructor, the `registerRoutes()` method, and provides an example of how to use it in an Express application.
